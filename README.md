I met with python in 2013. In September of the same year I retired from my job allocation.
I've got a lot of free time. And until I couldn't find new job. 
I don't want to permanently drink vodka, and I decided to write code in Python. 
Maybe I'll learn something and stay alive despite the alcohol in my life.
This is only the beginning, my friend.

P.s. My English is very bad, sorry for that.
